# Basic-Python-Programs
## Write a Python program to solve the following problems.
1. Calculate the Area of a triangle. 
2. To solve a quadratic equation.
3. Modify the above two programs such that the values are taken from the user. Follow this link for more instructions: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_user_input.asp
4. Follow the github cheatsheet to submit your work on this repository. Your submission should consist of two files including the modifications mentioned in the third step. 
5. Format of your file should be as follows: lastname_triangle.py and lastname_quadratic.py. Example: rane_triangle.py </br>

### Algorithms:
1. If a,b,c are three sides of a triangle. Calculate the semi perimeter of the triangle and use the distance formula. </br> Semi perimeter: s=(a+b+c)/2, Heron's Formula: area= (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5 </br> https://www.mathopenref.com/heronsformula.html
3. The standard form of a quadratic equation is: </br> 
<code>
  ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where
  a, b and c are real numbers and
  a ≠ 0
</code> </br>
<code>
  Solution:
  (-b ± (b ** 2 - 4 * a * c) ** 0.5) / (2 * a)
</code>
